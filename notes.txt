Prerequisties
-------------

Install WebView2 

from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/
downlolad the latest fixed version x86 architecture installer.

This will be something like:
Microsoft.WebView2.FixedVersionRuntime.96.0.1054.62.x86.cab

Install this on Windows.

A few necessary assemblies will be installed to
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Microsoft\Web Live Preview

We'll reference these in the component repository of Magic.


Demo Walkthrough
----------------

There are 3 small demo programs in the application:

Simple WebView2 Demo
WebView2 Roundtrip Scripting
WebView2 Dashboard Example

These demonstrate how to use and interact with the latest Microsoft embedded web browser control, WebView2.

This replaces the old Edge embedded browser.

Magic 4.8 will introduce support for CEFSharp as alternative which I have yet to install, this preview offers an alternative approach.

Let's walk through the demo programs.

Simple WebView2 Demo is a bare bones online program that hosts a WebView2 control.
Click Go to see the control activate displaying the Google Search homepage.
Click Send to send a query term from Magic to the browser and activate the search.
You can also use the browser control as normal.
Context menus and developer tools have been disabled in the code.
You can click Get as a simple example of getting the page source (we'll do more sophisticated calls in later demos).
Hit OK to exit.

You'll see the program contains only a few lines and a few c# snippets to manage this integration.

Next, run WebView2 Roundtrip Scripting
Again, a bare bones program sample however it does demonstrate the following practical features:
We can load a page from disk.
We can interact with the page like any.
We can trigger events (here clicking a button in the page) that are captured by Magic allowing it to process events in response.
From Magic we can query the page and data to retrieve the data field values into Magic.
We can execute scripts in the browser and also set or push in values from Magic.
This means that we can render complex forms, charts, diagrams, tables, maps and have 2-way communication between the browser and Magic.

Let's see that in action in WebView2 Roundtrip Scripting.
Click Load WebView2 to load a simple html page from disk. 
In the web page, enter first name, last name and click the browser Send to Magic button.
You'll see those values are captured in the Magic virtual fields on the form to the right.
A reset script clears those values in the browser.
We can play with the Get from WebView2 and Send to WebView2 buttons acting as you'd expect.
Finally we can also set the contents of the browser from a simple string (for illustration).
Click Set WebView2 from String.
Click OK to exit.

You'll see simple roundtrip control and integration of arbitrary data back and forth.

Again, in the program, you'll see only a few lines and a few c# snippets providing this functionality.

Finally, WebView2 Dashboard Example is an early preview of a hosted Admin Dashboard showing more graphically appealing layouts are easily achievable.
This demo currently has no browser-Magic interactivity or setup, we'll add that, though you can interact with the hosted webpage.
